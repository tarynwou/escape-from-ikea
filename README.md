# Escape From IKEA Game

## Programming 11 Project

Created: November 2018

***GAME PREMISE***

You, an exhausted and overworked employee at IKEA, are desperate to leave work. 

Get to the elevator in the Food Court without getting caught.

Don't run into any of your fellow employees or even worse, your manager. They will ask you to complete tasks for them which delays your escape! If you do, make sure you have the correct tools ON HAND to solve their tasks.

Avoid kids at all costs. If you happen to run into them you will need to find something to entertain them with. Don't try to pull any sneaky moves on them either because some of their parents check up on their kids often and might condemn you, further delaying your escape.

When faced with anything that will delay your escape (employees, managers, or children), you may use the 'run' command to run past the obstacle (it does not remove the obstacle from the room). However, there is only a 40% chance of success if this command is used.

You will need your "keycard" to clock out, and you will need your car "keys" to drive home.

Good luck!
